# flappy-bird-demo

> Please use the [newer flappy bird demo](https://github.com/bhauman/flappy-bird-demo-new) that is kept up to date with contemporary versions of ClojureScript and [Figwheel](https://figwheel.org). 
 
This repo contains the original flappy bird demo that I used in my video and blog post that introduced figwheel. This may or may not work and is here for posterity, please use the newer version. 

Read the [blog post](http://rigsomelight.com/2014/05/01/interactive-programming-flappy-bird-clojurescript.html) about this flappy bird demo.
